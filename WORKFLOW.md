# WORKFLOW.md — Symphony-Style Codex Factory

## Source of Truth
- The repo owns workflow policy, prompts, run artifacts, plans, and decisions —
  it is the canonical state.
- An external tracker (Linear, GitHub Issues, Jira) is OPTIONAL: when one is
  used, decomposition and task state are mirrored into it; when none is used,
  `.factory/decomposition.json` and `plans/` are the task graph.
- GitHub mirrors branch, PR, checks, and review evidence.
- gstack output is PROJECT-LOCAL: `.envrc` pins `GSTACK_HOME` to
  `<repo>/.gstack` (activate with `direnv allow`), so office-hours design
  docs, the decision store, and learnings are committed under
  `.gstack/projects/<slug>/` — shared by every dev, never stranded in a
  personal `~/.gstack`. Machine noise (sessions, analytics, browser profiles)
  is gitignored; JSONL stores union-merge via the `jsonl-append` driver
  (registered per clone by the SessionStart hook), so concurrent devs never
  conflict. History already in a personal store: `./forge gstack migrate`.
- Product intent lives in `docs/product/BRIEF.md`.
- Architecture and decision docs live in the repo under `docs/architecture/` and `docs/decisions/`.
- `docs/decisions/` overrides ambiguous or conflicting architecture guidance.

## Runtime Modes
Claude Code coordinates; Codex executes (local sessions and subagents).
The stack is Claude Code + Codex, deliberately: any future
orchestration must produce the same `.factory` artifacts.

## Factory Phases
0a. `discovery` — lightweight problem, stakeholder, and constraint discovery; no `.factory` ceremony required.
0b. `prototype` — lightweight proof work before committing to the factory loop; no `.factory` ceremony required.
1. `planning`
2. `decomposing`
3. `awaiting-approval`
4. `implementing`
5. `testing`
6. `reviewing`
7. `functional-check`
8. `pr-ready`
9. `done` or `blocked`

The sign-off gate sits between `prototype` and `planning`. Record accepted client sign-off with `python3 .agents/scripts/record_signoff.py`, which sets `client_signoff` in `.factory/run.json`. `update_run.py` and `pre_tool_use.py` refuse phases at `planning` or later until that field is true.

Every handover gate is preceded by a recorded GRILL (`.agents/prompts/griller.md`): an adversarial gaps-and-contradictions interrogation of what one role hands the next — `signoff` (client→PM: DISCOVERY/BRIEF/decisions), `epics` (PM→EM: epics/stories vs BRIEF), and `plan` (dev, EVERY task: the draft plan vs the story's acceptance criteria and the active decision corpus; `/grill-me` in Claude satisfies it, and `plan save` refuses without a same-issue pass). The verdict lands in `.factory/grills/<gate>.json` via `record_grill_from_json.py` (schema-validated, `generated_by: griller`); `record_signoff.py` and `forge roadmap import` refuse without a fresh pass — stale means the handover docs changed after the grill. Findings must resolve into doc edits or decision records before a `pass` is even recordable.

## Context Inbox & Doc Upkeep

Unstructured context (client emails, transcripts, notes) goes in
`docs/context/` — dumping is free, tracking is mandatory. `forge.py context
scan` registers files in `docs/context/ledger.json` (CI enforces freshness);
an agent following `.agents/prompts/harvester.md` turns pending files into
proposed decision records and BRIEF/architecture edits, then marks them
harvested with their outputs (`--ignored` requires notes). Pending context is
surfaced on four channels: the SessionStart hook count, step 1 of
`forge next`, the daily gardener issue, and — the hard stop — `plan save`
refuses while anything is pending. Broader doc freshness
follows `harness/nestjs-react/conventions/doc-gardening.md` (gardening agent —
convention today, not yet automated).

## Repo Hygiene — garbage cannot become contract

Devs will throw everything at the repo (gstack exhaust, old prototypes, raw
text). The doors check what enters; these mechanisms manage what accumulates:

- **Inbox guards**: `context scan` REFUSES files over 5MB and files with
  secret-shaped content (keys, tokens, credentials) — refused files stay
  unscanned, so the plan gate keeps blocking until they're fixed. The inbox
  itself is append-only by design (raw record); agents work from
  `context list --pending`, never by listing the directory.
- **Decision lifecycle**: statuses are `proposed | accepted | superseded` —
  never deleted, never hand-flagged. Replacing a decision goes through
  `forge.py decision new <slug> --supersedes <old-slug>`, which cross-links
  both records; the linter enforces both pointers resolve, that superseded
  records name their successor, and that ACCEPTED records have real
  Context/Decision/Consequences substance (boilerplate is refused). Agents
  read the live corpus via `forge.py decision list --active`; the retro
  (skill-miner) sweeps active decisions for mutual contradictions and
  proposes supersessions.
- **Prototype isolation**: the linter fails any production code importing
  from `prototype/` — reference forever, imported never is enforced, not
  hoped.
- **gstack noise**: derived caches (`brain-cache/`), per-session churn
  (`timeline.jsonl`), and slug caches are gitignored and excluded from
  `gstack migrate`; only design docs, decisions, and learnings are record.
- **Budget watchdog**: CI runs `check_repo_budget.py` — any tracked file
  over 5MB fails, and `docs/context/`, `.gstack/`, `prototype/` have
  cumulative budgets with early warnings. The budget is the backstop for
  the categories nobody predicted.
- **Ledger compaction**: `forge.py assumptions archive` moves resolved rows
  from finished tasks to `plans/assumptions-archive.md` at milestones;
  rejected skill proposals move to `.agents/skills/rejected/` (the miner's
  memory — it must not re-propose them without materially new evidence).

## Evolution Loop

Dev corrections are the harness's training data. At retro cadence, an agent
following `.agents/prompts/skill-miner.md` mines recurring patterns (3+
occurrences: fix-after-review commits, repeated blockers, superseded
decisions) into PROPOSALS under `.agents/skills/proposed/` — skills, memory
lines, or constitution changes, each with cited evidence. Humans promote or
reject; nothing self-activates. The daily `gardener` workflow opens a
GitHub issue whenever unharvested context or unreviewed proposals exist, and
the SessionStart hook surfaces the same counts at the start of every agent
session. The `/forge` Claude skill routes all of this.

## Event-Driven Delegation — signals

Delegation is not fire-and-forget. While a background rescue runs, the
orchestrator WATCHES `.factory/signals.jsonl` (Claude's Monitor tool on the
file, alongside the companion job status). A delegated worker raises a
signal the moment it hits a `contradiction` (plan vs decision vs doc),
genuine `confusion`, a hard `blocked`, or a `scope-change` — via
`forge.py signal raise --kind <k> --by <agent> -m "<sentence>"` — and PAUSES
that thread instead of guessing. The orchestrator resolves the event
(`forge.py signal resolve <id> --notes "<answer>"` — an answer, a decision
record, or a plan revision) and resumes the worker with the resolution.
Signals are schema-validated (`.agents/schemas/signal.json`, attested
`generated_by`), surfaced by `forge next` and the session-start hook, and
OPEN SIGNALS BLOCK `pr_ready` — an unanswered contradiction cannot ship.
The channel is task-scoped: archived to `.factory/history/<issue>/` and
cleaned at ship, like all task evidence.

## Determinism Contract

The rule that decides deterministic vs non-deterministic, once, so nobody
re-derives it per task:

- **Gates, state transitions, and evidence recording are deterministic** —
  scripts under `.agents/scripts/`, never skills, never judgment calls.
- **Content generation (plans, code, tests, reviews, harvests) runs on the
  phase's PINNED skills** — `harness.yaml` is the allowlist, not a suggestion.
  Adopting a new tool is a PR to `harness.yaml` + the artifact's schema (then
  `forge upgrade` propagates it), never a local dev choice.
- **The only door into `.factory/` is a recorder** (`record_*_from_json.py`,
  `forge roadmap import`) that validates the payload against its
  `.agents/schemas/<artifact>.json` — required fields, types, and a
  `generated_by` value inside the pinned allowlist. Nonconforming payloads
  and unpinned generators are refused outright; there is no override flag.
- **Mandatory phase skills are attested, not assumed.** Each schema's
  `required_skills` names the skills a feature type demands (e.g.
  `user_facing` → `emil-design-eng` + `frontend-design` on the testing
  artifact, `review-animations` on review artifacts); the recorder refuses
  the artifact unless `skills_used` attests them. Advisory skills are listed
  in `skills_used` when used. Same trust model as `generated_by`.
- **Prompts are the interface, recorder commands are the contract.** Devs
  speak intents ("start a task for invoices", "is this PR ready?"); agents
  run the mapped deterministic command. Anything an agent cannot route lands
  on `./forge next`.

Attestation trust model: `generated_by` is declared by the recording agent —
falsifiable, but only deliberately, and it leaves an audit trail (same model
as `plan assume` and decision records).

## Gating Model

Gates are deterministic and run at phase transitions (`update_run.py`, `record_*` scripts, `pr_ready.py`) and in `pre_tool_use.py` — never on prompt keywords or turn ends. One deliberate exception to "artifact gates only" (decision 0004): **while an active task is unplanned, planning is mandatory and enforced** — the PreToolUse hook blocks product-code edits (Edit/Write) and writing Codex delegation until the plan is saved and approved, telling the dev to switch to PLAN MODE. Planning-phase writes (plans/, docs/, decisions, harness machinery) and read-only exploration stay open. Everything downstream is still enforced at the artifact gates: unapproved work cannot pass verify, testing, review, or `pr_ready.py`.

## Task Graph Rules
- The planner owns decomposition.
- Decomposition is capability-driven; the recorded artifact is canonical
  (mirror to a tracker if the project uses one).
- Each leaf task must have write scope, dependencies, acceptance criteria, verify commands, and reviewer focus.
- One task should fit one implementation session and one review package.

## Project Roadmap

`plans/roadmap.json` is the durable, ordered backlog — the role handoff
artifact (see `docs/ROLES.md`): the PM's epics and the EM's stories, listing
everything left to build in execution order. It is recorded once from the
project-level decomposition after sign-off — **gated on an accepted
`epics-approved` decision (the PM→EM handoff)** — and survives every task
cycle: task-scoped `.factory/decomposition.json` is cleared on each intake,
the roadmap never is. Items carry `story`, `acceptance_criteria`, `epic`,
`skill` (frontend|backend|fullstack), and `assignee` (set by
`forge roadmap assign`, validated against the optional `plans/team.json`
roster, preserved across re-imports). Item lifecycle: `pending` → `active`
(set by intake) → `done` (set by `pr_ready.py`, with a link to
`.factory/history/<issue>/`). `forge next` suggests the next pending item
and flags unassigned ones to the EM. Scope changes are PR edits to the
file — future planning refines the roadmap, it does not silently regenerate
it; the per-task plan must satisfy the item's `acceptance_criteria`.

## Concurrency — one task per branch

Run state is branch-scoped by decision (docs/decisions): each story gets its
own branch (intake names it `feat/<key>-<slug>`), carrying its own committed
`.factory/` state through the loop; `pr_ready.py` archives to
`.factory/history/<issue>/` before merge, so main only ever accumulates
history. One active task per branch — parallel devs = parallel branches.
Roadmap status flips (`active`/`done`) happen on the task branch and merge
normally; the JSONL stores under `.gstack/` union-merge via the
`jsonl-append` driver.

**The orchestrator parallelizes aggressively when requirements separate.**
`depends_on` edges on roadmap items are the deterministic separation signal
(the decomposer derives them from real build-wave dependencies, never blanket
ordering); `./forge roadmap parallel` prints the ready frontier — pending
stories whose dependencies are all done — with a `git worktree add` + intake
command per story. Each worktree is a full checkout on its own branch with
its own `.factory/` state, so every gate (plan mode lock, plan grill,
recorders, ship gate) applies per story, concurrently. Implementations run
as parallel background rescues. Within ONE task, fan out only across leaf
tasks with disjoint `write_scope` in the recorded decomposition. Convergence
is designed to be conflict-free: `pr_ready.py` DELETES the task-scoped
`.factory/` state after archiving it (history keeps the record) and reduces
`run.json` to project fields + `last_shipped`, so merging story branches
collides on nothing but `plans/roadmap.json` status flips — and
`./forge roadmap heal` resolves those deterministically (union by key,
further-along status wins; mid-merge it rebuilds from the merge stages).
Commit the archive when `pr_ready` tells you to: evidence that isn't
committed isn't merged.

## Task Planning
Per-task planning runs in Claude Code plan mode by default (exploration
delegated to Codex: `/codex:rescue --model gpt-5.6-terra --effort high` —
read-only by default, never Claude Code itself, never raw `codex exec`); devs may instead use the
`planner-high` Codex agent — the contract is identical either way. The plan follows
`.agents/prompts/planner.md`, including the mandatory **Decisions** section: every choice not derivable from BRIEF,
architecture, or existing records becomes a `docs/decisions/` record
(`forge.py decision new`) before decomposition is recorded. Approval means the
plan is in-repo — `forge.py plan save --from <plan-file>` writes
`plans/active/<issue>-<slug>.md`; `update_run.py` refuses
`plan_status approved` without it.

During implementation, any call the plan does not cover is recorded the moment
it is made — `forge.py plan assume "<one sentence>"` appends it, dated, under
`## Implementation Assumptions` on the active plan AND as a structured row in
`plans/assumptions.md` (id, date, issue, assumption, status, guidance). The
ledger is the orchestrator's console: it reviews `open` rows and guides each
one — `forge.py assumptions resolve <id> --status confirmed|fix-needed|promoted
--notes "..."`. `pr_ready.py` refuses to ship a task with unguided
(`open`/`fix-needed`) rows; the session-start hook and `forge next` surface
the open count. Promoted assumptions become `docs/decisions/` records. An
assumption that would change scope or acceptance criteria is a report back
to the dev, not an assumption.

## Artifacts
Required run artifacts:
- `.factory/run.json`
- `plans/active/<issue>-<slug>.md` (the approved plan)
- `.factory/decomposition.json`
- `.factory/verify.json`
- `.factory/tests.json`
- `.factory/reviews/quality.json`
- `.factory/reviews/performance.json`
- `.factory/reviews/security.json`

Every evidence artifact is stamped with the commit it was recorded at.
`pr_ready.py` refuses unstamped artifacts, artifacts spanning different
commits, and evidence recorded before the latest code change (commits touching
only `.factory/`, `plans/`, or `docs/` do not invalidate evidence).

On PR-ready, `pr_ready.py` archives the run artifacts to
`.factory/history/<issue>/` and moves the plan to `plans/completed/` — the
durable record of what was decided and what was built.

## Execution Order
1. ensure architecture and decision docs are present in-repo
2. complete discovery and prototype
3. record client sign-off
4. create an approved plan
5. record decomposition
6. implement one leaf task — the implementer writes, runs, and records the automated tests
7. run `python3 .agents/scripts/verify.py`
8. run ONE autoreview pass (three lenses) and record the three review artifacts
9. run `functional-checker` when the decomposition has `user_facing: true`
10. run `python3 .agents/scripts/pr_ready.py`

## PR Ready Contract
A branch is PR-ready only when:
- plan status is `approved`
- decomposition status is `recorded`
- deterministic verification passes
- automated and functional test artifacts exist with no blockers
- all three review artifacts exist with score >= 8 and no blockers
- acceptance criteria have direct evidence
