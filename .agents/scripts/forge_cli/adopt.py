"""forge adopt — vendor the harness into an EXISTING repo (migration path).

Run FROM the harness clone, targeting a repo that predates the harness (a
prototype built with agents, an early client repo). Harness-owned machinery
is copied in; project content is never destroyed: the target must be clean so
every overwrite is a reviewable git diff, pre-existing AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md
are preserved into docs/context/ for harvest, and project-owned files are
created only where missing. Content mapping (what is prototype, what is
context, what becomes the BRIEF) is judgment — the knacklabs-migrate-project skill
drives that afterwards.
