# Symphony Forge

KnackLabs's process harness for building applications with **Claude Code coordination** and **Codex execution** — from discovery and client sign-off through scaffolding, per-feature delivery, and a self-evolving record of every decision.

## Quick Start (devs)

Everything is conversation — setup included. In any Claude Code session, say:

> **"Clone the KnackLabs harness from `github.com/knacklabs/symphony-forge` and run its setup."**

(One time per machine. Prefer a terminal? `git clone git@github.com:knacklabs/symphony-forge.git && cd symphony-forge && ./setup` does the same.)

Then, in a session opened in that clone:

> **"Set up a new KnackLabs project called my-app"**

The bootstrap skill updates the harness, checks your machine and installs any missing tooling (only logins stay yours), scaffolds the new repo, asks which GitHub org/repo should own it and pushes it there, then hands you off to work in the new repo. From then on, **ask "what now?" in any phase** — the agent reads the project's recorded state and walks you to the exact next action (Codex sessions get the same answer via `AGENTS.md`). Every step's underlying command lives in [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) — the deterministic contract, not something you type.

## Template, Not Fork — how client repos relate to this one

The harness is a **dependency you vendor, not an ancestor you fork**. The
only thing anyone ever clones is this repo, once per machine, as a tool —
your application is born as its own repo with its own history:

```text
this repo (cloned once, per machine)             your app repo (its own repo, its own history)
┌─────────────────────────────┐  "set up a new  ┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ the generator + upgrader —  │   project…"     │ born fresh — ZERO git       │
│ agents run it when you ask  │ ───────────────▶│ relation to the harness     │
│                             │  copies ONLY    │ app code, plans, decisions, │
│ improves over time…         │  machinery      │ evidence: all yours         │
└─────────────────────────────┘ ───────────────▶└─────────────────────────────┘
                                 "update my-app
                                  to the latest
                                  harness"
```

- **Create**: open Claude Code in the harness clone and say *"Set up a new
  KnackLabs project called my-app."* The agent checks your machine, scaffolds
  a fresh git-initialized repo beside the harness, asks which GitHub org/repo
  should own it, pushes it there, and tells you to open future sessions in
  the new repo. The app is built *inside that repo* — the harness clone is
  never where app code lives.
- **Upgrade**: when this template improves, nothing is merged or pulled into
  the app. In the harness clone, say *"Update my-app to the latest harness."*
  The agent rewrites ONLY the machinery (agent assets, adapters, the
  constitution, the gates) — it refuses a dirty tree and never touches app
  code, plans, docs, or evidence. You review the diff in the app repo like
  any PR.
- **Never**: don't fork this repo (shared history means every upgrade becomes
  a merge into your app code, and the harness's own run state collides with
  yours) and don't use GitHub's template feature (clean copy once, but NO
  upgrade path ever — and it drags this repo's plans, history, and evidence
  along). If an agent proposes either, that's a bug — the skills forbid it.

Sentences are the whole interface: the skills route what you say to
deterministic commands, and [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) lists
those commands under every step — as the contract and the fallback, not as
something you type.

## The Lifecycle

```text
0a discovery ──▶ 0b prototype ──[GRILL]──▶ CLIENT SIGN-OFF ──▶ scaffold (nx) ──[GRILL]──▶ epics OK'd ──▶ roadmap + team
                                              (hard gate)                     (PM accept)                    │
      ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
      ▼
  per feature (own branch):
  intake ▶ PLAN MODE (forced) ▶ [GRILL] ▶ plan save ▶ decompose ▶ per stage: implement+test ▶ local review ▶ commit ▶ verify ▶ review ▶ [assumptions guided] ▶ PR
             (Claude)                     (+ surfaces)  (stages)          (Codex, attested)   (until clean)                  (ONE autoreview)     (ship gate)
```

- **Before sign-off**: lightweight on purpose — no ceremony, no time-box. Discovery via gstack `/office-hours`; the prototype that earns sign-off is preserved in `prototype/` as the permanent UX reference.
- **After sign-off**: deterministic gates. Plans live in `plans/`, decisions in `docs/decisions/`, evidence in `.factory/`; the ship gate archives every shipped task's plan + proof to `plans/completed/` and `.factory/history/`.
- **Continuously**: dump raw context (client emails, transcripts, notes) into `docs/context/` — dumping is free, tracking is automatic. Say *"process the context dump"* and an agent scans it into the ledger, harvests it into proposed decisions and BRIEF/architecture updates, and marks each file. You can't miss pending context: it greets every session start, tops every *"what now?"*, raises a daily `gardener` issue, and **blocks plan approval** until harvested or explicitly ignored. Dev corrections get mined into proposed skills that humans promote.
- **The repo learns from itself**: review findings are structured and clustered across tasks — ask *"are we fixing the same thing again?"* and the agent shows which defect classes recur; the same class recurring 3+ times triggers a refactor story + invariant decision, never a fourth patch (decision 0005). Repeated failures become ledgered lessons that resurface before anyone touches the same paths again (decision 0006). Say *"this is out of scope for now"* and the parked scope keeps an explicit revisit trigger instead of vanishing.

Phase ownership — which tool runs which phase — is declared in [`harness.yaml`](harness.yaml).

## The Gates

Every handoff is an artifact plus a deterministic gate. You never operate the
gates — you ask for the next thing, and a skipped gate shows up as the agent
relaying a refusal that names exactly what's missing. The "Enforced by"
column describes that machinery. In lifecycle order:

| # | Gate | Refuses until | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Signoff grill** | an adversarial gaps/contradictions pass over DISCOVERY/BRIEF/decisions is recorded — fresh (docs unchanged since) and `pass` | `record_signoff.py` |
| 2 | **Client sign-off** | an accepted `client-signoff` decision names a human | `record_signoff.py`; every later phase checks the flag |
| 3 | **Epics grill + PM accept** | the epics/stories are grilled vs the BRIEF AND the PM accepts `epics-approved` | `forge roadmap import` (checks both, in order) |
| 4 | **Roster check** | assignees exist on `plans/team.json` (when a roster is defined) | `forge roadmap assign` |
| 5 | **Planning lock** | the active task has an approved, saved plan — until then product-code edits and writing Codex delegation are DENIED, with routing to PLAN MODE | PreToolUse hook (decision 0004 — the one sanctioned keystroke gate) |
| 6 | **Rescue-only invocation** | always: raw `codex exec` is denied in every phase, no escape hatch — `/codex:rescue` is the runtime | PreToolUse hook |
| 7 | **Plan grill** | the draft plan survives `/grill-me` vs the story's acceptance criteria + active decisions — same-issue, fresh, `pass` | `forge plan save` |
| 8 | **Surface Impact** | the plan classifies every surface (runtime/API/data/CLI/UI/docs/tests) — Deferred and Unchanged-by-design rows carry reasons | `forge plan save` |
| 9 | **Pending context** | every `docs/context/` dump is harvested or explicitly ignored (and scans REFUSE secrets/oversize files outright) | `forge plan save`; `context scan` |
| 10 | **Schema + generator + skill attestation** | every evidence payload matches its `.agents/schemas/` file: `generated_by` on the allowlist, mandatory design skills attested in `skills_used` on user-facing artifacts | every `record_*` script |
| 11 | **Stage loop** | every decomposition stage ran its loop — order-enforced start, LOCAL autoreview until clean, commit, done | `forge stage start/done`; `pr_ready.py` refuses open stages (decision 0007) |
| 12 | **Assumptions guided** | every `forge plan assume` row for the task is confirmed/promoted by the orchestrator (`fix-needed` keeps blocking) | `pr_ready.py` |
| 13 | **Refactor ratchet** | a `kind: refactor` story shows non-positive net product-source line delta — refactors shrink or hold the line | `check_refactor_delta.py` in `pr_ready.py` |
| 14 | **Frozen gates** | the vendored gate surface (scripts, schemas, prompts, hook config) matches `constitution/VENDOR_MANIFEST.json` — locally edited gates make every other gate's evidence unverifiable; re-vendor or upstream, never patch in place | `check_vendor_integrity.py` in `pr_ready.py` (warned at session start) |
| 15 | **Ship gate** | approved plan, decomposition, verify OK, tests + 3 reviews ≥ 8 with no blockers, functional when `user_facing`, all evidence commit-stamped, same-commit, fresh | `pr_ready.py` — archives to `.factory/history/`, marks the roadmap item done |
| 16 | **Hygiene floor** | decision lifecycle intact (supersede links resolve, accepted records have substance), no prototype/ imports, schemas match harness.yaml, repo within size budgets | `check_dual_runtime.py` + `check_repo_budget.py` in CI |

Advisory (surfaced, never blocking): recurring finding classes — *"are we
fixing the same thing again?"* (3+ hits of one class ⇒ consolidate via a
refactor story, decision 0005); ledgered lessons — *"what did we learn about
these files?"*; parked scope whose trigger fired — *"did any deferral come
due?"*; and the loop-health audit — *"are the watchers themselves decaying?"*
(ignored escalations, stale deferrals, dead lessons: `forge audit`, run at
every ship, surfaced by `forge next`, and run daily in CI by the
`harness-health` workflow — which also opens an automated `forge upgrade`
PR when the vendored harness falls behind; merging it stays human).

Human-only, always: **accepting a decision** (sign-off, epics, promotions) —
the one command a person types themselves. The agent drafts the record,
relays the accept command, and waits; it never runs it.

## Who Runs What (skills by stage)

`harness.yaml` is the ALLOWLIST — these are the only pinned tools per stage,
and recorders refuse evidence from anything else (`generated_by` is checked
against `.agents/schemas/`). Adopting a new tool = a PR here, never a local
choice.

**Devs only ever say the "You say" column.** The other columns are what the
AGENT invokes and records in response — shown so you know what happens on
your behalf, not for you to type.

| Stage | You say | Skill / agent invoked | Deterministic record |
|---|---|---|---|
| machine setup | "Set up my machine" | `knacklabs-new-project` skill → `./forge doctor --fix` | doctor report |
| new project | "Set up a new KnackLabs project called X" | `knacklabs-new-project` skill → `./forge init` | scaffolded repo |
| existing repo | "Migrate this repo into the harness" | `knacklabs-migrate-project` skill → `./forge adopt` | vendored machinery; old context → `docs/context/` |
| any phase, lost | "What now?" | `/forge` skill → `./forge next` | — |
| 0a discovery | "Let's run office hours" | gstack `/office-hours` | `docs/product/DISCOVERY.md`, `BRIEF.md`; design docs + decisions in `.gstack/projects/` (in-repo via `.envrc`) |
| 0b prototype | build freely | ponytail (lite) allowed | preserved under `prototype/` |
| grills (every gate) | "Grill the handover" / "Grill the epics" / "Grill me on this plan" | `griller` contract; `/grill-me` satisfies the plan gate | `record_grill_from_json.py` → `.factory/grills/`; sign-off, roadmap import, AND plan save refuse without a fresh pass |
| sign-off | "The client signed off" | none — HUMAN runs `decision accept` | `record_signoff.py` → `run.json` |
| workspace | "Scaffold the workspace" | Codex `/codex:rescue` + `SCAFFOLD_PROMPT.md` | nx workspace |
| epics (PM) | "Build the project roadmap" | `docs-decomposer` proposes; PM accepts `epics-approved` | epics in `plans/roadmap.json`; import gated on the accept |
| stories + distribution (EM) | "Record the backlog", "assign ENG-101 to alice" | `./forge roadmap import` / `assign` / `team set` | stories w/ acceptance criteria, `@assignee` (roster-checked) |
| intake | "Start the next task on the roadmap" | `/forge` → `intake.py` | `.factory/run.json` |
| plan | "Plan this task" | Claude PLAN MODE — forced by the hook (or Codex `planner-high`); exploration ONLY via `/codex:rescue --model gpt-5.6-terra --effort high`, read-only | grilled plan → `./forge plan save` → `plans/active/` |
| decompose | "Decompose it" | `docs-decomposer` | `record_decomposition_from_json.py` (incl. `user_facing`) |
| implement + test | "Implement it" / "work the next stage" | Codex `/codex:rescue --background` per stage (implementer writes the tests); `user_facing` tasks MUST use `emil-design-eng` + `frontend-design` (attested in `skills_used`, enforced by the recorder); each stage ends LOCAL autoreview → commit | `./forge stage start/done` → `.factory/stages.json`; `record_test_from_json.py --kind automated` |
| lessons | "what did we learn about these files?" / "remember this" | none — deterministic ledger | `./forge lesson relevant` / `add` → `plans/lessons.jsonl` (schema-validated, deduped) |
| verify | "Run verify" | none — deterministic script | `verify.py` → `.factory/verify.json` |
| review | "Review it" | **autoreview** (ONE Codex run, three lenses) | `record_review_from_json.py` ×3 |
| functional check | only if `user_facing: true` | `functional-checker` subagent | `record_test_from_json.py --kind functional` |
| ship | "Is this PR ready?" | none — deterministic gate (refuses unguided assumptions, missing/stale evidence) | `pr_ready.py` → archives + roadmap done |
| guide assumptions (orchestrator) | "review the assumptions" | `./forge assumptions list --open` / `resolve` | `plans/assumptions.md` — ship gate reads it |
| context dump | drop files in `docs/context/`, then "scan the context" | `/forge` → `./forge context scan` | `docs/context/ledger.json` |
| context harvest | "Process the context dump" | agent per `harvester.md` → proposed decisions + BRIEF edits | `./forge context mark --harvested\|--ignored` |
| retro / evolution | "Mine for skills" / "are we fixing the same thing again?" | agent per `skill-miner.md` (incl. lessons curation) + daily `gardener` workflow; `./forge findings patterns` flags recurring classes | proposals in `.agents/skills/proposed/`; refactor stories (`kind: refactor`, delta-ratcheted) on the roadmap |
| park scope | "this is out of scope for now" | none — deterministic ledger | `./forge defer add --why --trigger` → `plans/deferrals.md`; `forge next` surfaces open triggers |

```

## Why This Shape

- **One canon, two runtimes.** Standards live once (`constitution/`, `AGENTS.md`, `harness.yaml`); `.claude/` and `.codex/` are thin adapters. `check_dual_runtime.py` fails CI on any duplication.
- **Gates at phase transitions — plus exactly one keystroke gate.** Hooks are quiet by default; the deterministic gates (`record_signoff.py`, `record_*` recorders, `pr_ready.py`) do the enforcing. The one sanctioned exception (decision 0004): while a task is unplanned, the hook denies product-code edits and forces PLAN MODE. `/codex:rescue` is the only Codex invocation — raw `codex exec` is denied everywhere.
- **Grill before every handoff.** Sign-off, epics, and every task plan pass an adversarial gaps-and-contradictions interrogation whose recorded verdict the gate checks — stale or blocked grills don't open doors.
- **Evidence is attested, not asserted.** Every artifact carries `generated_by` (allowlist-checked) and `skills_used` (mandatory design skills enforced on user-facing work), stamped to the commit it attests.
- **Decisions are exhaust, never forms.** Planning forces a Decisions section; harvesting turns raw context into records; humans confirm every `accepted`; replacements go through `--supersedes`, and accepted records must have substance.
- **Garbage cannot become contract.** Secret/size guards at the inbox, repo budgets in CI, prototype-import ban, gstack noise gitignored, ledgers compacted, rejected proposals remembered.
- **Evolution is curated.** Recurring corrections become *proposed* skills and constitution PRs; nothing self-activates. The fast loop is deterministic: lessons ledger in, relevance out (decision 0006); the slow loop is structural: recurring finding classes escalate to delta-ratcheted refactor stories instead of endless patches (decision 0005).
- **One owner per phase.** Overlapping skills (gstack `/ship`, ponytail in factory code, nested reviewers) are explicitly disabled in `harness.yaml`.
