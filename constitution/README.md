# CAW Engineering Constitution

This directory is the **single source of truth** for CAW engineering standards.
The former Notion pages are deprecated; changes land only as PRs to this repo.
Deviations must be deliberate and stated ("Context is King" — prefer the
standard, deviate with a written reason).

Precedence when guidance conflicts (see also `harness.yaml`):
1. This constitution wins over any skill's guidance.
2. Factory gates (`.agents/scripts/`, `.factory/` artifacts) win over workflow skills.
3. gstack skills win over other third-party skills.

In generated repos this directory is vendored and pinned (`VENDORED_FROM`);
update by re-vendoring from the harness, never by editing in place.
